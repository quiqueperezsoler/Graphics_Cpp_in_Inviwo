This tool supplies a GUI to run the python scripts contained in this folder to create processors/modules.

It assumes that you have your inviwo repos on the same folder depth (e.g. C:\inviwo\inviwo-dev and C:\inviwo\research-dev) and that the executable is stored in inviwo-dev/tools.

As of now, the module list does not update if you create a module from this application and switch back to the processor creation view. Just restart the application.

You are very welcome to modify the program. If you want to fiddle with the code you can find it here: https://github.com/JochenJankowai/PythonRunner
